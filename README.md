# SAFA - Structural Alignment for Functional Annotation

This repository contains the scripts and workflow clodes used to perform structural alignment of protein model(s) against a library of structures (e.g., the PDB70 structural library), along with parsers and post-processing/analysis scripts. Additionally, the processing codes used to gather the metadata associated with a structural library are included to enable users to develop their own annotated structural libraries. 

In addition to the codes, jupyter notebooks are included to visualize results and demonstrate the steps of each workflow. Tests for each code base are provided as is a small scale example of all components of SAFA.
