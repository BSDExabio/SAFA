Version 1.0.0

A dask.distributed workflow code to automate the alignment of a library of 
structures against a library of structures. This code was used to automate the 
structural alignment for functional annotation reported in (CITE). Currently,
the workflow utilizes US-align2 (https://github.com/pylelab/USalign) to
perform the single-chain to single-chain protein structural alignment 
calculations.
